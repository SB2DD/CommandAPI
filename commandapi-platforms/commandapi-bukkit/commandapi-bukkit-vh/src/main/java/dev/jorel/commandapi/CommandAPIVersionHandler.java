 * This file handles the NMS version to be loaded. The CommandAPIVersionHandler
 * file within the commandapi-core module is NOT used at compile time. Instead,
 * the commandapi-vh module is loaded instead, which doesn't use reflection to
 * load NMS instances.
 * <p>
 * NMS classes implement {@code NMS<CommandListenerWrapper>}. The type
 * CommandListenerWrapper isn't visible as in this Maven module (it's not
 * included and in some cases, cannot be included because Maven will only select
 * one version of a specific project (in this case, it'll only import one copy
 * of Spigot, almost always the latest stable version (from 1.16.5)). In
 * Eclipse, this can produce an error saying that a class cannot be resolved
 * because it is indirectly referenced from required .class files So sidestep
 * this, we introduce a second intermediary class NMSWrapper_VERSION which
 * depends on CommandListenerWrapper and then our main NMS_VERSION class extends
 * that.
